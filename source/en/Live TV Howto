This is a guide to showing live TV in a Xibo layout.
 
One solution to the live TV problem is to create an IP video stream and display it in
an HTML frame.  There  are two applications needed to achieve this:
 * TVHeadend - which generates the IP video stream and
 * VLC (Video Lan Client) which displays the stream on the client device.
 
We will assume you are using an Android client for your Xibo server in this example.
This how-to is written
 
Hardware:
Raspberry Pi (this document is tested on a Model B)
A 4GB SD card with Raspbian
DVB tuner (I'm using an August T208 from ebay)
 
Software:
Raspbian operating system dated 2015-02-16
Linux driver for your USB Tuner
TV Headend
VLC
 
 
Getting started:
The first task is to make sure you have drivers for your chosen USB TV receiver.
To test this run the command 
dmesg
and look at the last few lines, here are mine:

usb 1-1.2: new high-speed USB device number 5 using dwc_otg
usb 1-1.2: New USB device found, idVendor=187f, idProduct=0202
usb 1-1.2: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=0
usb 1-1.2: Product: MDTV Receiver
usb 1-1.2: Manufacturer: MDTV Receiver
DVB: registering new adapter (Siano Nice Digital Receiver)
usb 1-1.2: DVB: registering adapter 0 frontend 0 (Siano Mobile Digital MDTV Receiver)...
usbcore: registered new interface driver smsusb

If you get a file not found message here, then you will need to obtain a driver. This
is somewhat beyond this walk through, however most of the models on the market today
use one of a few common chipsets.

The August T208 unit I'm using uses a Siano DVD Nova chip.
to install the driver, change directory 
````cd /lib/firmware````

download the driver (remember this is the driver I need, yours may be different.
````sudo wget http://www.linuxtv.org/downloads/firmware/dvb_nova_12mhz_b0.inp````

once the driver is installed, we can install TV Headend and update all the software.
First add the TV Headend repository
````cd /etc/apt
sudo nano sources.list
	deb http://apt.tvheadend.org/stable wheezy main````

Now add the signing key	
````curl http://apt.tvheadend.org/repo.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add - ````

Add the repository
````sudo apt-add-repository http://apt.tvheadend.org/stable````

Finally, update the list of updates and perform the upgrade
````sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade````
