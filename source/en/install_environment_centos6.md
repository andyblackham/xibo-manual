The commands below are a guide to installing and configuring Xibo on a Centos 6 platform, specifically a Centos 6 Minumal installation.  A typical use case is where your server only has a CD-ROM drive, rather than a DVD-ROM and cannot boot from USB or other medim.  Centos 6 Mininal install is available for CD-ROM installtion.

These instructions assume that your hardware is functioning correctly, any RAID etc is externally managed (maybe in a RAID card) and that a vanilla Centos 6 Mininal Installation has completed suceesfully with no errors.

Centos 6 is available for x686 and IA64 archtitecture here: http://wiki.centos.org/Download

Some of the steps below require additional inputs from you the administrator, these are marked.
